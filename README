ruler 1.0

Creates a plain always-on-top, borderless window, you can set the initial 
size, color, and opacity of the window. Then at runtime you can resize, move, 
and lock the window's size.

Despite the name it's not intended for _meassuring_. Personally, I use it for 
reading and temporay padding in tiled wms, thems are what it was made for, 
but there may be other instances it could help, idk tho, censor bar maybe.


Keyboard Shortcuts (case-insensitive):
  CTRL+L    toggle resize lock
  CTRL+Q    quit
  ESC       quit


Install:
requires pkg-config at build time, and SDL2 at runtime.
```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make 
sudo make install
```
