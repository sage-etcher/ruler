ruler 1.0

Creates a plain always-on-top, borderless window, you can set the initial 
size, color, and opacity of the window. And at runtime you can manipulate the
window's size and position (and a few more things).

Despite the name it's not intended for meassuring. I primarily use it as a way 
to keep my place while reading, and as padding in tiling window managers. It's
a very simple program so if you can find use for it, great! if not, that's
equally alright.

Keyboard Shortcuts (case-insensitive):
  CTRL+L    toggle resize lock
  CTRL+Q    quit
  ESC       quit
