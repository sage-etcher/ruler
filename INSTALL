Install the needed libraries: SDL2, SDL2_image, cargs

Build and install ruler from source
  $ git clone https://github.com/sage-etcher/ruler.git
  $ cd ruler
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install



Common Issues:
Issue at the `./configure` step:

error:
  ...
  ./configure: line ####: syntax error near unexpected token `-mconsole,'
  ./configure: line ####: `AX_CHECK_COMPILER_FLAG(-mconsole, WINDOWS_FLAG=yes, WINDOWS_FLAG=no, -Werror -mwindows)'
fix:
  AX_CHECK_COMPILER_FLAG is provided by autoconf-archive. The error is due to 
  the aformentioned macro not being known. Installing autoconf-archive fixes 
  the issue. After installing it, `./autogen.sh` must be rerun.

  debian       `sudo apt-get install autoconf-archive`
  arch         `sudo pacman -S autoconf-archive`



error:
  configure: error: The SDL2 library could not be found.
  or
  configure: error: The SDL2_image library could not be found.
  or
  configure: error: The cargs library could not be found.
fix:
  configure could not find the library. If it is not installed, that's
  your issue. If it's installed in a non-standard location, you need to pass 
  custom LDFLAGS, CFLAGS, and PKG_CONFIG_PATH values to `./configure` for it
  to find them.



error:
  pkg-config could not be found.
fix:
  the `pkg-config` program is not found on the path. Is it installed?
